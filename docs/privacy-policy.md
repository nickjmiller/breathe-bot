# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** June 25, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how breathe-bot ("the Bot"), a Discord bot designed to provide guided breathing exercises, collects, uses, and protects information.

## 1. Information We Collect

breathe-bot is designed with user privacy in mind and collects **minimal information** necessary for its operation:

* **No Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** The Bot does **not** collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information from Discord users, such as your Discord ID, username, messages, or any other data that could identify you personally.

* **Command Usage (Anonymized):** The Bot may log anonymized, non-identifiable data related to the use of its commands (e.g., how often a specific breathing exercise is requested). This data is used solely for diagnostic purposes, to monitor the Bot's performance, and to improve its functionality. It cannot be linked back to individual users.

* **Voice Channel Data (No Recording):** When the Bot joins a voice channel to provide a breathing exercise, it **only plays audio**. It does **not** record, process, listen to, or store any audio from users in the voice channel. Your conversations and audio within Discord voice channels remain private and untouched by the Bot.

## 2. How We Use Information

The limited information collected (anonymized command usage) is used exclusively for:

* Maintaining and improving the Bot's performance and reliability.

* Understanding general usage patterns to enhance future features.

## 3. Information Sharing

breathe-bot does **not** share, sell, rent, or trade any collected information with third parties. As no personal data is collected, there is no personal data to share.

## 4. Data Security

We are committed to ensuring the security of the minimal data the Bot processes. While no online service can guarantee absolute security, the design of breathe-bot, which avoids collecting sensitive personal information, inherently reduces privacy risks.

## 5. Your Choices and Rights

Since breathe-bot does not collect personal data, there are no specific personal data access, correction, or deletion rights to exercise regarding information held by the Bot. Your data privacy is primarily governed by Discord's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

You can remove the Bot from your Discord server at any time, which will cease any further interaction or anonymized command logging from that server.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Bot after any changes signifies your acceptance of the revised policy.
